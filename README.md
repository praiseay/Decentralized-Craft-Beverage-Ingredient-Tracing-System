# Craft Beverage Blockchain Tracing System

A decentralized blockchain solution for end-to-end traceability in the craft beverage industry. This system provides transparent tracking of ingredients from farm to glass, ensuring quality, authenticity, and regulatory compliance.

## System Overview

This blockchain-based platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Ingredient Registration Contract** - Records the sources of hops, grains, and other brewing inputs
2. **Production Batch Contract** - Tracks specific batches through the brewing process
3. **Quality Testing Contract** - Records laboratory analysis results
4. **Certification Contract** - Verifies organic, local, or specialty designations

## Features

- **Complete Supply Chain Visibility** - Track ingredients from farm to finished product
- **Immutable Records** - Tamper-proof documentation of all production stages
- **Quality Assurance** - Verify testing results and certifications
- **Consumer Transparency** - QR code integration for consumer-facing ingredient information
- **Regulatory Compliance** - Streamlined documentation for regulatory requirements

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Ingredient Registration Contract

Records the origin and details of all raw materials used in the brewing process:

- Hops (variety, farm location, harvest date, lot number)
- Grains (type, origin, processing method, lot number)
- Yeast (strain, generation, source)
- Water (source, treatment methods, analysis results)
- Adjuncts (type, origin, processing information)

### Production Batch Contract

Tracks the brewing process from ingredient selection through packaging:

- Batch identification and creation date
- Ingredient inputs linked to Ingredient Registration Contract
- Brewing parameters (mash schedule, fermentation details, etc.)
- Processing steps with timestamps
- Packaging information and formats
- Quantity produced and inventory tracking

### Quality Testing Contract

Documents all quality control and laboratory testing:

- Pre-production ingredient analysis
- In-process testing results
- Final product analysis (ABV, IBU, color, gravity, pH, etc.)
- Microbiological testing results
- Shelf-life studies and stability testing
- Links to testing facilities and methodologies

### Certification Contract

Verifies and maintains records of various certifications:

- Organic certification status and documentation
- Local ingredient verification
- Specialty designations (gluten-free, vegan, etc.)
- Award recognitions
- Sustainability practices

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain environment
- Smart contract development experience
- Web3 integration capabilities

### Deployment Steps

1. Deploy the Ingredient Registration Contract
2. Deploy the Production Batch Contract with reference to the Ingredient Registration Contract
3. Deploy the Quality Testing Contract
4. Deploy the Certification Contract
5. Configure access controls for different user roles
6. Implement frontend interfaces for each user type

### User Roles

- **Suppliers** - Register ingredients and their attributes
- **Brewers** - Create production batches and link ingredients
- **Quality Technicians** - Enter testing results and quality data
- **Certifying Authorities** - Verify and record certifications
- **Consumers** - View product information through QR codes

## Benefits

- **Brewers**: Streamlined documentation, quality control, and supply chain management
- **Suppliers**: Showcase product quality and establish trust with brewers
- **Regulators**: Easy access to compliance documentation
- **Consumers**: Transparency into ingredients and production methods

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with IoT devices for automated data collection
- Machine learning for quality prediction and process optimization
- Carbon footprint tracking and sustainability metrics
- Marketplace functionality for ingredient sourcing
